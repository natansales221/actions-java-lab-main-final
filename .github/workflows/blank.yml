# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.

# The StackHawk HawkScan action makes it easy to integrate dynamic application security testing (DAST) into your
# CI pipeline. See the Getting Started guide (https://docs.stackhawk.com/hawkscan/) to get up and running with
# StackHawk quickly.

# To use this workflow, you must:
#
# 1.  Create an API Key and Application: Sign up for a free StackHawk account to obtain an API Key and
#     create your first app and configuration file at https://app.stackhawk.com.
#
# 2.  Save your API Key as a Secret: Save your API key as a GitHub Secret named HAWK_API_KEY.
#
# 3.  Add your Config File: Add your stackhawk.yml configuration file to the base of your repository directory.
#
# 4.  Set the Scan Failure Threshold: Add the hawk.failureThreshold configuration option
#     (https://docs.stackhawk.com/hawkscan/configuration/#hawk) to your stackhawk.yml configuration file. If your scan
#     produces alerts that meet or exceed the hawk.failureThreshold alert level, the scan will return exit code 42
#     and trigger a Code Scanning alert with a link to your scan results.
#
# 5.  Update the "Start your service" Step: Update the "Start your service" step in the StackHawk workflow below to
#     start your service so that it can be scanned with the "Run HawkScan" step.
